description: Begin a CFD session by orienting on the nemo-cli project's current status and recent decisions without scanning source code. Use when the user asks to "start session", "get oriented", or invokes the CFD session-start ritual.
---

Run the Context-First Development session-start ritual. Read **only** the following
files, in order, and do not scan source code unless a follow-up question requires it:

1. `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` — what is in progress, what is blocked, what is next.
2. `docs/decisions/_index.md` — recent decisions that may affect the next change.

Then produce a brief (≤ 8 lines) summary covering:

- What was being worked on in the previous session.
- What is currently blocked and why.
- What the next priority should be, based on `CURRENT_STATUS.md` and any open
  questions noted there.

Stop after the summary. Do not begin implementing anything until the user gives you a
specific task.
